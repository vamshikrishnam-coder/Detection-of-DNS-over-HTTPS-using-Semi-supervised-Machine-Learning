# Detection-of-DNS-over-HTTPS-using-Semi-supervised-Machine-Learning
The project aimed to classify requests as either DoH or non-DoH, and then further classify DoH requests as either malicious or benign using a semi-supervised machine learning model. The results of the project showed that the model achieved a high accuracy rate, indicating that it can successfully differentiate between different types of requests.
